        <h1>What is OOP?</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Object Orientation uses real world representations of Objects to preform a task in a program. Java is
            an Object-Orientated Programing language, meaning that it can be used to make programs that implement
            objects who have behaviors and attributes. Using OOP methods such as <strong>Objects &amp; Classes</strong>,
            <strong>Inheritance</strong>, <strong>Encapsulation</strong>, <strong>Abstraction</strong>, and <strong>Polymorphism</strong>
            (more on that in OOP2), a programmer can create working reusable methods (behaviors) and variables
            (attributes) who can interact with each other in a hierarchy without a loss in security.</p>
        <h1>Objects and Classes</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Classes</h4>
        <p>Now, what is a class then? A class is a blueprint for which objects can be made from. It contains some main
            characteristics to function properly. Attributes, Behaviors, and <strong>Constructors</strong> (allows the
            creation of objects within memory). An instance of a class using the keyword <strong>new</strong> creates an
            object located in the memory during runtime (a reference variable determines the specific object, acts like
            an ID).</p>
        <p>Here is an example program that shows some of the concepts from above using the Programmer class.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="prettyprint" style="background-color: transparent">
            class Programmer {
            //declaration of attribute
            String name;

            //defining behaviour program
            public void program(){
                //method
            }

            //creating main method to run the instance of Programmer inside the Programmer class
            public static void main(String args[]) {
                //Creating an new object through instantiation
                Programmer p = new Programmer();//instance of class Programmer
                p.program();//using the objects&#39; behaviour
                System.out.println(p.name);//accessing an attribute through the reference variable
            }
        }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>A <strong>constructor</strong> within a java class is called when an instance of the class is created. It
            locates the memory needed for the object. Every single time an instance of an object is created, a
            constructor must be called to create the object. In java there are two types of constructors: <strong>Default
                constructors</strong> (with no-arg/parameters) and <strong>constructors with parameters</strong>. These
            constructors initialize the attributes for an object, within a default constructor, the values are default
            with no parameters (set by the programmer), but in a constructor with parameters, the values are passed into
            the constructor through the parameters allowing them to be changed.
            A constructor can be made using the following template:<code class="prettyprint">&lt;class name&gt;(params){} </code>
            If a constructor is not defined by the programmer, than a default constructor is made. A constructor must be
            present in a class for an instance of the class to be made. Multiple constructors can also be present by
            making constructors with different parameter lists. This is known as <strong>constructor
                overloading</strong>.</p>
        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Inheritance is an OOP concept where one object exhibits the attributes and behaviors of a parent object. This
            concept is important to the core foundations of OOP as it allows for class hierarchies to form, where one
            class builds on another using the it&#39;s own and the parent&#39;s attributes and behaviors.
            <br></p>
        <h4>Sub Classes &amp; Super Classes</h4>
        <p><strong>Sub Class/Child Class:</strong> A Subclass is a class which inherits the Super class. It is also
            called an extended class or a child class.
            <br>
            <strong>Super Class/Parent Class:</strong> A Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits it&#39;s
            features. It is also called a parent class.
            <br></p>
        <h4>Implementing Inheritance</h4>
        <p>The keyword <strong>extends</strong> allows the implementation of Inheritance within a class. Within
            inheritance, there are relationships that link classes and there attributes and behaviors. The two
            relationships are an <strong>IS-A</strong> and <strong>HAS-A</strong> (known as <strong>Aggregation</strong>
            relationships. Sub classes have a IS-A
            relationship with their super classes, as they are the extension of that class. classes also have HAS-A
            relationships when the class has a reference to an instance of another class or another instance of the same
            class.</p>
        <h4>Types of Inheritances</h4>
        <p>In Java there are 3 basic types of relationships between classes through inheritance: single, multilevel and
            hierarchical. These relationships determine how data binding is distributed throughout each class that
            extends the previous class(es)</p>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
                <img src="../images/inheritance1.jpg" class="rounded" alt="in1">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            There is also multiple and hybrid inheritance, where classes can implement more than one entity, yet they
            are only achievable by implementing
            multiple interfaces.
            <br> In this example, 3 classes are shown using multilevel inheritance
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="prettyprint" style="background-color: transparent">
            //Parent class Animal is defined with a method
            class Animal {
                void sleep() {
                    System.out.println("sleeping");}
            }
            //The Bird sub class extends Animal and adds its own unique method
            class Bird extends Animal {
                void squawk() {
                    System.out.println("squawking");}
            }
            //Penguin extends Bird which extends Animal, allowing it to use their respected methods
            class Penguin extends Bird {
                void swim() {
                    System.out.println("swimming");}
            }
            //In TestMain a Penguin object is made which is able to access the methods
            //in the Penguin, Bird, and Animal classes
            class TestMain {
                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    Penguin p = new Penguin();
                    p.sleep();
                    p.squawk();
                    p.swim();
                }
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Encapsulation is a concept in OOP that allows security to be established within classes and hierarchies. This
            is achieved by using <strong>access modifiers</strong>. By making certain fields <strong>private</strong>,
            information is protected and is not able to be modified beyond the intentions of the program. Access is
            given to the fields through <strong>public</strong> method who access the attributes through their class.
            This way object attributes and components can be re-used without allowing open access to the client.</p>
        <p>Encapsulation is yet again a very powerful tool in OOP. It lets the programmer to re-use functionality while
            still having security within the program. It allows access to components of code to be used as many times as
            needed with more efficiency, it also allows the programmer to change data without the program crashing</p>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
                <img src="../images/encap.png" class="rounded" alt="in1">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Encapsulation can be thought about using the analogy of a pill capsule as all the data inside a class is put
            into one unit like a capsule. one pill with many different part within. In Java, the difference is that the
            data can be accessed and modified through <strong>setter</strong> and <strong>getter</strong> methods. Where
            getters, &quot;get&quot; the data (Ex. <code class="prettyprint"> public String getName() {} </code>) and
            setters that &quot;set&quot;/modify the data (Ex. <code class="prettyprint"> public void setName (String
                name) {} </code>)</p>
        <h4>Access Modifiers</h4>
        <p>In Java, access modifiers determine the &quot;usefulness&quot; of variables and methods within a program
            (basically where the memory of said variable/method is cashed). In java there are 4 access modifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>private:</strong> Means that the modified entity is only available inside the current class.
            </li>
            <li><strong>default:</strong> If no modifier is assigned, then the default one is given. Default modifiers
                are only accessed within a package.
            </li>
            <li><strong>protected:</strong> Allows the access to anything within a inheritance hierarchy, it can be
                applied to data, methods, constructors, but not classes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>public:</strong> This modifier means that it is able to be accessed anywhere within a program.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the example below, the OOP concept, encapsulation, is demonstrated in a Java program. The attribute &quot;model&quot;
            is encapsulated by the access modifier private.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="prettyprint" style="background-color: transparent">
            //Car class
            public class Car {
                //Encapsulate the attribute model with the access modifier private
                private String model;

                //A getter method, gets (returns) the model
                public String getModel() {
                    return model;
                }
                //A setter method, sets(modifies) the model
                public void setModel(String m) {
                    model = m;
                }
            }

            //Test class
            public class MainTest {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Car c = new Car();
                    c.setModel("Honda");//Sets the model String to "Honda" through the Car setter method
                    System.out.println(c.getModel());//Prints the model using the Car getter method
                }
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>
            In short, Encapsulation provides control over a classes data to the client without sparring security in the
            process. It is an easy way to achieve hidden data and allow code re-usability as well.
        </p>
        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Abstraction may not seem like an important concept within OOP, yet is plays a role in keeping one&#39;s code
            neat, tidy, organized, and readable. What data abstraction aims to do, is to represent complex content in a
            more simplified manner (to be defined later). It&#39;s like knowing how to use a computer to type, without
            knowing the complex systems running behind it. In Java, abstraction is demonstrated with classes, variables,
            and methods representing more detailed code which is later defined within other layers of the program. It is
            also yet again another way of allowing content to become reusable within a program.</p>
        <p>Abstraction is a process of finding characteristics of a program and only representing the functionality of
            the program to the client/user. It focuses more on what actions are to be done, then how they are achieved.
            In Java Abstraction is achieved by <strong>interfaces</strong> and <strong>abstract classes</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Abstract Classes</h4>
        <p>An Abstract class is any Java class that is declared abstract using the <strong>abstract</strong> keyword. In
            an abstract class, there can be abstract and non-abstract methods. The class itself needs to be extended and
            all abstract methods need to be instantiated. The class itself cannot be instantiated. note: Abstract
            methods do not have implementation, they are implemented later within classes that have extended the
            abstract class (the abstract methods must be implemented within the subclass unless it is another abstract
            class)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are declared with the abstract keyword.</li>
            <li>May have abstract, non-abstract, and static methods.</li>
            <li>May have constructors.</li>
            <li>Cannot be instantiated.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>An example for the usage of abstract classes can be seen in the Shape class and the classes that extend it.
            In this example the Shape class just shows the functionality of the program and not the math behind it.</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-java" style="background-color: transparent">
            <code>
            //Abstract Shape class
            abstract class Shape {
                protected double base;
                protected double height;
                protected double area;

                //Shape param constructor
                Shape(double b, double h) {
                    base = b;
                    height = h;
                }

                public double getArea (){
                    return area;
                }
                //abstract method implemented in Rectangle and Triangle
                abstract void area();
            }

            //Rectangle class extends abstract class Shape
            class Rectangle extends Shape {

                Rectangle(double b, double h) {
                    super(b, h);
                }

                //Implementation of abstract method area
                public void area() {
                    area = base * height;
                }
            }

            //Triangle class extends abstract class Shape
            class Triangle extends Shape {

                Triangle(double b, double h) {
                    super(b, h);
                }

                //Implementation of abstract method area
                public void area() {
                    area = (base * height)/2;
                }
            }

            //test class
            class TestAbstraction1 {
                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    Triangle t = new Triangle(12,10);
                    t.area();
                    System.out.println(t.getArea());

                    Rectangle r = new Rectangle(20,10);
                    r.area();
                    System.out.println(r.getArea());
                }
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h4>Interfaces</h4>
        <p>An Interface is not a class, it acts more like a blueprint of a class. It contains static
            <strong>finals</strong> (constants) and abstract methods. interfaces can only have abstract methods (and
            default yet it isn&#39;t too important) and is a tool to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance. in an
            inheritance hierarchy they represent an IS-A relationship. (note: interfaces like abstract classes cannot be
            instantiated). Interfaces can be declared using the the <strong>interface</strong> keyword and by following
            the format: <code class="prettyprint">interface &lt;interface_name&gt;{} </code></p>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
                <img src="../images/mi.jpg" class="rounded" alt="in1">
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>Reasons to Use an Interface</h4>
        <p>There are 3 reasons why interfaces are useful in OOP: They can be used to achieve abstraction, they can show
            functionality of a program, and they allow for multiple inheritances with interfaces through loose

        <p>In the following example, multiple inheritance is shown. Notice that the methods within the interfaces are
            not given modifiers (default is abstract)</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="prettyprint" style="background-color: transparent">
            //First Interface A
            interface A {
                void print();//methods are always abstract in interfaces so no need to assign the modifier
            }
            //Second interface C
            interface B {
                void sayHello(); //methods are always abstract in interfaces so no need to assign the modifier
            }
            //Multiple inheritance is achieved and the implementations of bot methods print
            //and sayHello are in class C
            class C implements A, B {
                public void print() {
                    System.out.println("This is from Interface A");
                }
                public void sayHello() {
                    System.out.println("Hello There");
                }
                //Within the class, the implemented methods are able to be used
                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    C c = new C();
                    c.print();
                    c.sayHello();
                }
            }
